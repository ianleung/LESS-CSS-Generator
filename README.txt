LESS CSS README
------------------------------------------------
Author's Note - This project was started by me to learn PHP, Javascript, HTML, and general web coding as a beginner. I understand alot of my code may be considered sloppy/not-optimal. Any input or comments are appreciated and can be sent to ianmhleung@hotmail.com. Thanks!
IMPORTANT - May need to change directory paths to make it work for you.

What this does
------------------------------------------------
 (here is an article on how to install plugins...http://urbangiraffe.com/articles/how-to-install-a-wordpress-plugin/)
Upon activation from the plugin section of wordpress, you can access the plugin admin page from Settings in the wp-admin dashboard. 

Config - You can set your variables here, there are colour, number and letter variables.
Demo HTML - You can write your HTML here, it will be displayed in the scrollable div directly above, and be affected by your stylesheet. Should have default HTML written that you can edit/remove. 
Less-CSS - You can write your less-css here; basically it is css with the variables from the first tab. Should have default less written here using the variables from the first tab. You can read about less-css here - http://lesscss.org/ This tab will also have a textarea with all your current variables and values to use as reference, and commands native to less.
Compiled-Less-CSS - shows the compiled version of your less, which will convert all your variables/commands to plain css and be applied to the demo HTML.
Stylesheet Manager - Here, you can create, edit, delete stylesheets. Each stylesheet will have its own config, demo HTML, Less-CSS.
Includes Manager - Allows you to choose which stylesheets to include to your head for your website!

Directly below the tab bar, you will see that you can add, edit and reset additional variables to the ones I included. Reset will delete all your added variables.

That is pretty much it! Any questions can be directed to me at ianmhleung@hotmail.com. Thanks for taking your time to test out my first plugin.
